# This should be introduced in the interactive python shell. Where the arguments to print should just be passed to the shell.

# We should keep it to the 4 basic arithmetic functions at first since most kids don't get introduced to other functions until later.

print(2 + 2)

print(3 - 2)

print(2 * 3)

# Introduce the concept integer numbers and floating point numbers.  
print(8 / 5)

# Introducing variables...

x = 10
print(x)

y = 5

# We can apply arithmetic operations to our variables.  
print(x * y)
print(x - y)

# At this point we will introduce an error by calling a variable that has not been defined yet IE 'k'.
# Explain the output caused by the error and how it can be useful to debug a program
