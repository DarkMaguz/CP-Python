This is a *simple* collection of **notes** used to introduce Python as a first programming language for kids.

Suggested order of introduction:
1. numbers
2. strings
3. lists
4. HelloWorld (_Here we introduce .py files_)
5. input
6. control-statements

The tutorial folder contains another approach introducing python. (_Mostly in Danish though_)

Some other things of interest:
CryptoFun (Intermediary: _lists_)

PyGames (Intermediary)

wedriver (Intermediary)

cs1.3 (Advanced: _Requires extra files and Linux running Xorg **not** Wayland_)
